Among other things, we'll be judging your commitment and motivation. The Masterclass in Minsk is a lot of work and requires a great deal of commitment on everyone's part. This commitment must apply both during the lessons and at the cottage, where you'll be asked to cook and help with household chores. We will assess your ability to fit into a group. The audition will not take place in the traditional way. Some exercises will be carried out in a group. During the exercises, you must be able to show your passion for theatre, your desire to improve, your personality and your ability to take on board the teachers' comments. to take on board the teachers' comments.

        <li>Plastics/Dance study: choreography</li>
        <li>An animal" study: you have to embody an animal and imagine a situation in which your behaviour changes as a result of an event. Highlight the animal's psychological character </li>
        <li>An object" study: by embodying an object, you must imagine a situation in which your behaviour changes as a result of an event. Highlight the psychological character of the object </li>
        <li>Exercise: you can show us what you want</li>
        <p>During these two afternoons with your potential future teachers and fellow students, as well as former Masters students, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the Minsk course. Finally, the audition will end with a one-to-one interview with the teachers. </p>
