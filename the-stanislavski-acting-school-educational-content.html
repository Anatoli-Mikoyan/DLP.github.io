    <h1>What is the project about?</h1>
    <p>The workshop takes place in total immersion to fully understand the Russian Theatre School as if the participants were real Russian or Belarusian students! This school pays particular attention to the working conditions and requirements that allow the realization of this art. Thus, this approach is experienced as an artistic encounter but also as a human experience through the discovery of a country, a culture, a collective life based on sharing and solidarity, and values of demand, rigor, and perseverance in work.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>THE INTENSIVE WORKSHOP</b> Discover the Russian Theatre School for 4 weeks (50h/week) during the month of August at the theatre.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>THE MASTERCLASS</b> Encounter with the Russian Theatre School during 9 months of intensive training (1800h of classes), from October to June, in various Minsk theatres.</p>

    <h2>The Creative Immersion</h2>
    <p>The workshop takes place in total immersion to fully understand the Russian Theatre School as if the participants were real Russian or Belarusian students! This school pays particular attention to the working conditions and requirements that allow the realization of this art. Thus, this approach is experienced as an artistic encounter but also as a human experience through the discovery of a country, a culture, a collective life based on sharing and solidarity, and values of demand, rigor, and perseverance in work.</p>
    <center><img src="images/contenue-pedagogique-1.jpg" alt=""></center>
    <h2>A Multidisciplinary Training</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to offer trainees intensive and multidisciplinary training. Although essentially focused on actor techniques, this training also integrates various disciplines necessary for actor training. Indeed, the art of the actor, as conceived in the "Russian Theatre School," calls upon not only the imagination but also the actor's body and voice, as instruments that must be mastered to precisely express emotions. These disciplines are approached not as "specialties" but as "tools" for the actor to help develop and refine their art. "All artists have an instrument: the pianist has his piano, the painter has his brush, the singer is supported by music. The actor has only himself: his body is his instrument." Igor BLINKOV (Acting Technique Professor)</p>

    <h2>The Theatrical Concert</h2>
    <p>The theatrical concert is a highly recognized genre in Eastern countries. It is a study work that brings together the best works of the students across all disciplines, supporting the multidisciplinary approach in actor training. It showcases all the skills that the students have accumulated after their training: singing, dancing, and of course, theatrical art. Thus, for each of our proposals, a theatrical concert punctuates our training sessions.</p>
    <center><img src="images/contenue-pedagogique-3.jpg" alt=""></center>
    <h2>No Need to Speak Russian!</h2>
    <p>All classes are simultaneously translated into French by interpreters. By removing the language barrier through translation, it is possible to follow the professors' classes like a Belarusian student. To make the experience complete, one must try to understand the atmosphere in the classroom as the work ethic sets the tone and pace of the training.</p>
